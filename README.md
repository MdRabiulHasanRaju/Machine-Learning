# Machine-Learning
Some of machine learning based project that I have done during my university's course.
In this course, I have worked with various Machine Learning algorithms, 
that is supervised and unsupervised. 
In supervised machine learning I implemented Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM. 
And In Unsupervised I implemented K-Means Clustering. 
I also worked with one of deep learning algorithm ANN.
